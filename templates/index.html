            <p class="leading-relaxed opacity-90">
                I source my fabrics from second hand places (i.e. Thirft Stores, FB Marketplace, Estate Sales) that come

                in all shapes, sizes, and patterns. I have sewing patterns that can be made with fabric for people that

                come in all shapes and sizes. And I have friends that come in all shapes and sizes (that I do not know

                exactly). But what patterns can I make with which fabric for what friend?
